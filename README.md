# python-scatter-plot-ci
This Python script takes data as a list and produces a scatter plot with customized axis, markers, legend, linestyles, fonts and other visual tweaks. It also calculates and plots 95% confidence interval bands based on the given data.

Note: This script only runs on Python 3.

### Dependencies:
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)

Running the script using the data in the code produces the following plot:
![plot](https://github.com/AKstudios/python-scatter-plot-ci/blob/master/tout_vs_radon_pid_red.png)

The script can be manipulated to add any custom data to plot (as long as the two lists are the same size), including additional data series and their customizations if needed.
